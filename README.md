Instead of saying "the software has bugs "you can just say that the software has been made dirty ,This allows even for the less educated abiut tech in the room to get the point of bugging.
Also instead of saying "there is a typo in your repo" you can just say you have made a mistake in the writing. This enhances understanding.

They help clarify the the concepts. Visuals guide people well and logically so they can understand the processes sequentially.
Examples make it familiar for the audience to relate to the topic and thus enhances understanding.
